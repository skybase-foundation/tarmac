# Withdrawing from the SEAL Engine via Etherscan

The SEAL Engine UI has been removed from the app. The SEAL Engine was deprecated by Sky governance on **April 22, 2025** (MakerDAO Poll `Qmctp1eN`) and replaced by the SKY Staking Engine. Any remaining positions can be withdrawn directly on-chain via Etherscan.

The on-chain exit fee is **0** — users withdraw 100% of their position.

## The Seal Engine contract

Positions are held in the LockstakeEngine (v1), denominated in MKR:

| Contract             | Address                                      | Denomination |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| LockstakeEngine (v1) | `0x2b16C07D5fD5cC701a0a871eae2aad6DA5fc8f12` | MKR          |

## Step 1 — Find your urn and read your position

Each position is held in a per-user "urn" contract. To find yours and check what's locked, you'll read from both the engine and the underlying Vat contract.

On the engine's Etherscan page, open **Contract → Read Contract**:

1. Call `ownerUrnsCount(<yourAddress>)`. Most users have exactly one urn at index `0`. If you have multiple, repeat the withdrawal steps below for each index.
2. Call `ownerUrns(<yourAddress>, <index>)` → returns your **urn address**. Save this value.
3. Call `vat()` → returns the **Vat address**. Save this value.
4. Call `ilk()` → returns the **ilk** (bytes32 identifier). Save this value.
5. Open the **Vat contract** on Etherscan at the address from step 3, go to **Read Contract**, and call `urns(<ilk>, <urnAddress>)` using the values from steps 4 and 2. This returns `(ink, art)`:
   - `ink` = your locked MKR collateral (18-decimal units)
   - `art` = your outstanding USDS debt (18-decimal units)

## Step 2 — Repay USDS debt (skip if you have no debt)

If `art` from Step 1.5 is non-zero, repay it before withdrawing collateral. `free` will revert otherwise.

1. On the **USDS token contract**, call `approve(<engineAddress>, <amount>)` with an amount ≥ your debt. A safe choice is `2^256 - 1` (max uint256).
2. On the engine's **Write Contract** tab, call `wipeAll(<yourAddress>, <index>)` to repay the full debt.

## Step 3 — Withdraw your collateral

On the engine's **Write Contract** tab:

```
free(
  owner: <yourAddress>,
  index: <urnIndex>,
  to:    <yourAddress>,
  wad:   <amountIn18Decimals>
)
```

Use the `ink` value from Step 1.5 as `wad` to withdraw everything. Tokens are sent directly to the `to` address.

## Notes & gotchas

- `wad` values are 18-decimal MKR.
- `free` reverts if any USDS debt remains — always `wipeAll` first.
- If `urnFarms(<urnAddress>)` is non-zero, `free` auto-withdraws from the farm; no explicit `selectFarm(0x0)` is required.
- To claim pending rewards before withdrawing, call `getReward(<owner>, <index>, <farm>, <to>)`.
- Only the position owner can call these functions, unless `hope(<owner>, <index>, <delegate>)` has been set.
